# aws_job_recommendation_syetsm

Overview:

This program reads in your location data (only if you authorize it to do so) and it will recommend nearby jobs for you to apply.

Implementation Details:

In this project, I applied AJAX technologies to developed an interactive web page for users to register, log in, search and apply. Implemented 3 Java servlets with RESTful APIs to handle HTTP requests and responses Built MySQL database on Amazon RDS to store position data fetched from Github API Designed and implemented content-based algorithms using keywords extracted from MonkeyLearn API Performed end-to-end tests of system functionality and deployed to Amazon EC2

Instruction:

To use this system on your local computer. You will need to download the Tomcat v9.0 server. Connect to the server in your IDE(if you are using IntelliJ, you can connect your server in the Configuration section). After that, you should connect to Apache Server and MySQL database on Amazon RDS. At last, in your browser, type in http://localhost:8080/jupiter/ (or your specified port number). Then you will see the page. If you are a first-time user of the platform, please register first.
